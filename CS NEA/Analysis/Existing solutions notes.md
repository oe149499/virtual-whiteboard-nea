# Microsoft OneNote
### General notes
- Took AGES to load
- Have to divide in to notebooks, sections AND pages
- Incredibly aggressive autocorrect
- Drawing lines exists but is asinine
	- Have to use "ruler" that covers entire page
	- Can't edit existing lines much
- No rotation handle and corner dragging is broken
- UI is not consistent with state
> All of the rotation commands can be used in any combination to get the result that you want; however, you canâ€™t currently rotate an image freely by any degree. If you need that kind of precision, rotate your picture in a photo-editing application before you [insert it on a page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/insert-a-picture-on-a-page-aa8da3cc-c0fa-485b-987c-53714a48c41f).

- At least 5 different versions, not all of which currently exist, but all of which look similar and exist in any google search attempt to solve the problem that apparently doesn't exist on other versions of this useless piece(s?) of software
