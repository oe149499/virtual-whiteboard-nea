Currently, my family uses a whiteboard in the kitchen to track upcoming events. However, this can be inconvenient as this can only be seen and edited in person.

This project aims to solve this by creating a digital emulation of a physical whiteboard, along with adding other utility functions that are made possible by the digital medium. This will enable coordination and planning to be done remotely at any time, as opposed to requiring everybody to be in the same room.

For this project, I plan to only create a web client as this will be compatible with the most devices, but in the future I may go on to create native apps for different devices.
