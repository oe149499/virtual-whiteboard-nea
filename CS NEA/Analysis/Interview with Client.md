What sort of functionality would you like the whiteboard to have?


> I think the following features are most important:
> 
>  * Being able to use it on a phone and a laptop
>  * Adding to the whiteboard with both text boxes and some sort of pen tool
>  * Adding in text boxes
>  * Being able to move things around on the board and delete them
>  * Having multiple people edit the same board in parallel so that everybody sees the same thing


What other functionality would be useful?


> * I would like to be able to cross off items somehow
> * It would be useful to be able to switch between multiple whiteboards
> 	* Sending items between boards would be useful


What other tools or canvas items could the whiteboard have?


> Some sort of way to categorise or order information would be good
> > What about a system of "tags" which can be placed anywhere on a board, and a search tool that lets you list tags and jump to their location on the board?
> > > Yes, please. That sounds really helpful.
> 
> Inserting web links would be useful, including a thumbnail of the page the link points to.
> > I can do web links fine, but fetching a thumbnail would not be feasible within the project timescale
> 
> I would like to be able to upload/drag+drop a file (such as a spreadsheet/word doc) and display it on the board
> > Parsing Office documents is not feasible, but images/text files could work
> > > No problem. Would I be able to cut and paste information from a text document into a text box?
> > > > That wouldn't be a problem to implement
> > > I would like to be able to upload an image such as a screenshot
> > > > That should be fine


What other features would you like to include?


> I think some sort of private board would be a good system
> > How about passcode protected boards
> > > I think that would work well
