## Microsoft OneNote
I had been forced to use this previously in lessons and so I have some  familiarity with it, though its many frustrations drove me away from it somewhat. When trialling it more thoroughly, I found that it had several issues that made it unsuitable for the problem.

Firstly, the software is divided into 5 different versions (Windows 10, iOS, Mac, Android, and Web), which despite accessing the same notebooks have varied feature support and reliability. This can make a task which is trivial on one device impossible on another.

Secondly, editing ability is limited at best. There is currently no way to rotate any object except for in increments of 90 degrees, and furthermore this functionality does not seem to be available on all platforms. Furthermore, [this help page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/rotate-pictures-and-objects-on-a-page-in-onenote-65f12233-3618-461c-b5d1-53825c087238) recommends using a separate application to edit photos beforehand. This is not only slow and inconvenient but cannot be applied to other objects such as text or "ink" drawings.

## Miro
I had not used Miro before, but had heard of it from various friends and family. Upon trying it, the first thing I noticed was that the web version was somewhat slow to load, and occupied a significant amount of my laptop's resources. While my laptop is not particularly powerful, the system I aim to create should work on phones where this level of resource usage would be unacceptable. Miro does also provide a mobile app, though in this case the app is not feature-complete as it appears to be developed separately from the web version.

While Miro is a significant improvement over OneNote, it is not without some flaws, such as limited ability to work with custom shapes, along with selection of objects being clunky and confusing. For example, the rotation tool appears as a not immediately obvious icon in the bottom left corner of the selection. When releasing the mouse the selection box, and therefore rotation handle, is recomputed to fit the grid. This interrupts the flow of editing.

Another disadvantage is the lack of features in the free tier. While the most import parts are available, several utilities are limited or unavailable.

One notable feature that sets Miro apart is the existence of a separate "Interactive Display" mode targeted at static screens such as on a wall in an office. This makes it a much more powerful tool for group organisation as discussions and collaboration can be simultaneously done in person and remotely.
