## Microsoft OneNote
I had been forced to use this previously in lessons and so I have some  familiarity with it, though its many frustrations drove me away from it somewhat. When trialling it more thoroughly, I found that it had several issues that made it unsuitable for the problem.

Firstly, the software is divided into 5 different versions (Windows 10, iOS, Mac, Android, and Web), which despite accessing the same notebooks have varied feature support and reliability, making a task which is trivial on one device impossible on another.

Secondly, editing ability is limited at best. There is currently no way to rotate any object except for in increments of 90 degrees, and furthermore this functionality does not seem to be available on all platforms. To add insult to injury, [this help page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/rotate-pictures-and-objects-on-a-page-in-onenote-65f12233-3618-461c-b5d1-53825c087238) recommends using a separate application to edit photos beforehand, which is not only slow and inconvenient but cannot be applied to other objects such as text or "ink" drawings.
