Data flow throughout the application is based on a few key mechanisms:
- `State`, a value which can change throughout the lifetime of the application
	- To reduce the need to manually pass around callbacks and propagate notifications, `State` encapsulates this process into an interface with two fundamental operations:
		- Read the current value
		- Attach a callback to be notified when the value changes
	- This is then used to implement other operations such as:
		- Create a derived state from a function mapping the current value to a new one
		- Combining multiple states together in order to create a state derived from multiple inputs
	- 
- `Channel`, an asynchronous queue
	- A channel consists of a sender with the ability to push items, and a receiver which is an asynchronous iterable of items
